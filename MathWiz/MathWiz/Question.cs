    /*  Kevin's note:
     *  I thought about this for a while. Should we split questions into multiple classes?
     *  Such as multiple choice questions exending off of the base question class, 
     *  and having randomly generated questions and customized questions be their own classes?
     *  However, I decided against it because it was going to make the Test and Grade classes a lot more complicated
     *  Instead, I have just provided multiple different constructors that will make it act like their own unique objects.
     *  This is an important decision, and if we get it wrong, it could cost a lot of time, so we need to talk it over.
